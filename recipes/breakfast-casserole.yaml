  - ingredients:
      - 3/4 pound uncooked sausage, casings removed (You can use ground turkey,
        ground beef or ground chicken instead)
      - "optional: 1 teaspoon dried rosemary to give the sausage more flavor"
      - 2 bell peppers, diced (any color you prefer; about 2 cups)
      - 1 cup sliced mushrooms
      - 1 cup fresh spinach
      - 1/2 medium yellow onion, diced
      - 1 teaspoon minced garlic
      - salt and black pepper
      - 4 slices day-old bread (gluten free, whole wheat, white, sourdough, any
        kind you like)
      - 10 large eggs
      - 1/2 cup milk (I use almond milk, any milk works) (Mom used a can of
        coconut milk)
      - 1/2 cup shredded cheese - any works - pepper jack, mozzarella, gouda,
        swiss, cheddar
    instructions:
      - Set a large skillet over medium heat and coat it with nonstick spray or
        a drizzle of olive oil. Place sausage in the skillet and begin to break
        it up with a spatula or fork. Stir in the rosemary and brown the
        sausage, about 6-7 minutes.
      - Meanwhile, set a 2nd skillet over medium heat and coat it with nonstick
        spray or a drizzle of olive oil. (If you have a skillet large enough to
        fit both the sausage and veggies, you can just add the veggies to the
        sausage that is browning in step 1.) Add the peppers, mushrooms,
        spinach, onion, garlic, and a sprinkle each of salt and pepper. Begin
        stirring and cooking the veggies down until tender, about 6-8 minutes.
      - Set sausage and veggies aside.
      - Generously grease a 9×13 baking pan. Break the bread into pieces and
        place in the pan in an even layer.
      - In a large bowl, whisk the eggs, milk, and 1/4 cup shredded cheese
        together. Pour half of this egg mixture over the bread. Top with the
        sausage and vegetables, then the remaining egg mixture and remaining 1/4
        cup cheese. Add a sprinkle of salt and pepper on top.
      - Cover casserole with plastic wrap or aluminum foil and refrigerate for 2
        hours or overnight– or up to 1 day. Allow it to come to room temperature
        before baking.
      - Preheat the oven to 375°F (191°C). Bake the casserole, uncovered, until
        the top is golden, edges are crisp, and a toothpick inserted in the
        center comes out clean– about 40-45 minutes. I like mine on the super
        crisp side, so I bake it for around 45-50 minutes. Allow to cool for 10
        minutes, then slice and serve. Tastes awesome with hot sauce on top.
      - Leftovers keep well in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. Reheat in the
        microwave to your liking.
notes:
  - Mom made this for Owen's baptism.  It was great!

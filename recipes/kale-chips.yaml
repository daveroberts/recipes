  - instructions:
      - Preheat oven to 250F
      - Wash and dry the kale completely dry.  Remove stems
      - Add 1-2 tsp olive oil and sea salt.  Too much oil prevents kale from
        crisping.
      - Cook in oven.  Will take about 15 minutes.  Keep an eye on them to make
        sure they don't burn.

name: Thick Hot Chocolate
notes:
  - I didn't measure the milk, probably added closer to two cups, and it was
    still too thick.  1 Tbsp cornstarch was too much.  It was also very sweet
    (used 72% chocolate).  Probably reduce sugar from 2 Tbsp.
  - Reduced corstarch and sugar, was better.  maybe reduced cornstarch and sugar
    too much.  2tsp cornstarch and 4tsp sugar?
  - Tried with almond milk and no chocolate bar, total failure

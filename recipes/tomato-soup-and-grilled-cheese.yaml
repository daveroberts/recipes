  - name: Grilled Cheese
    ingredients:
      - bread (Hamburger buns work well here)
      - American cheese
    instructions:
      - Butter a large skilled, add unbuttered bread
      - Add bread, then cheese, then cheese again, then bread.  If using
        hamburger buns, turn them "inside out", so what's normally touching the
